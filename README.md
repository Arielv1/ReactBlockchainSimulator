Blockchain react simulator, built using React + Node.js

Simulates transactions between users and mining.

In order to reduce time of mining each block there's the option to define the number of leading zeroes each block needs in order to be considered valid.

There's no balance validataion - a user can have a negative balance and perform transactions.
